There is also a new aux. radiator in the front (1969 mini cooper) with a 1200 cfm electric fan. It is tucked in behind the front beam and helps keep everything cool.

The body and paint is pretty decent besides one dent on passenger fender. Interior is about a 7.5 out of 10. New tires and radiator. I purchased the car to use as my primary commuter since it has an automatic transmission (my other Honda is a 5speed) and later learned it has some minor over heating problems. About 30 minutes into driving i noticed the temp gauge start to climb a little over the middle mark and then drop back down. The temp never stays up, it always comes back down and seems to do this more on street than freeway. I have no clue what the exact cause is but after researching, a few things i came up with are, AIR in cooling system, Bad thermostat, weak water pump, fan not working ( Which it does). No signs of a failed head gasket which is good but i don't have the time or knowledge to trouble shoot the things i mentioned above. The radiator was replaced by previous owner but i wouldn't rule that out just yet as i don't know the condition it was in when she bought it.", "This car may be good for a mechanic or someone who knows their way around cars.Selling As is.

The car is also equipped with navigation and a back-up camera which makes it a lot easier when backing up or parallel parking. The moonroof  is pretty nice when you want a cool breeze without using the a/c. It does have a few cosmetic blemishes which I've taken pictures of so you can see. There's some scratches on the doors and the paint on the front bumper is peeling off in some areas. There is also a small scratch/tear in the leather of the rear seat. Other than those cosmetic blemishes the car has served me well for the past 7 years. I would keep the car since it's been so reliable and great on gas, but I'm looking to buy a larger vehicle like an SUV now. I recently had the oil changed and also bought brand new tires.

There's some minor wear on the seats and a bit of the body paint, the passenger side window button doesn't work but is controlled by the driver, and the adjustable side-view mirror button doesn't work so you have to manually adjust the side-view mirrors. It has seat warmers, a cassette player, sun roof, leather beige seats, manual transmission, aluminum alloy wheels, and the other features found on a 1999 VW New Beetle GLS 2.0 with a 4 cylinder engine.

Then when you're ready to buy, you pay me the full price in cash first as a security deposit and precaution against damage while you test drive it, and you can take the car for a test drive with you driving and me in the passenger seat. If all is well, we can finalize the sale. Any damage to the car during your test drive will cancel the offer of sale and will come out of the cash you pay me which will be treated as a security deposit rather than payment for the car.
